# PasswordGenerator


## Description 

> In this Project I had to create a randomized generated Password based off certain criterial parameters. The User will click "Generate Password" which will prompt them to answer a series of questions. These questions are relative to the length of the Password between a parameter of (8-128). Once that is selected the next prompt will include whether User would like to have "Special Characters, Upper/Lower Characters, as well as Numbers. The User must select at least one of the four. The Generated Password is designed to identify and determine if a number not only meets the parameter amount, but also if whether or not a number was input at all - rather than words.
